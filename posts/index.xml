      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;step-by-step-guide-to-resolve-grub-rescue-and-boot-into-windows&#34;&gt;Step-by-Step Guide to Resolve GRUB Rescue and Boot into Windows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you tried removing Linux and are now greeted with a black screen with &amp;ldquo;Grub Rescue&amp;rdquo; on it, don&amp;rsquo;t panicâ€”we&amp;rsquo;ve all been there. We&amp;rsquo;ll get through it without affecting any other data by following a few simple steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-occurred&#34;&gt;Why This Occurred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you installed Linux, it created a folder in the main EFI partition alongside Windows. This folder pointed to the partition where Linux was installed, and when you removed Linux (likely using Windows partition tools), the computer panicked because it couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the necessary folder. We can fix this by getting your system back to Windows and updating the boot manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
